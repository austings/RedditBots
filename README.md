turns out that websites don't like queries from web crawlers on their dictionary sites. For demonstration purposes I have hard coded a defintion for it to fetch. Some open source sites like https://freedict.org/ will allow such scrubbers, so simply change the source and it should work as intended.http://reddit.com/r/test is a subreddit that you can use freely with bots and test without fear of being banned.
